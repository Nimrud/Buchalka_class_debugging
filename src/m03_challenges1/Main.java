        // CHALLENGE 1
        // Set up test stubs
        // Create a JUnit test class that contains a test method for each method in Utilities class.
        // When you run the tests, they should all fail.

        // CHALLENGE 2
        // Create tests for the Utilities.removePairs() method
        // This method accepts a string and removes any pairs it contains
        // by removing one half of the pair
        // Fix the method in Utilities class, so it does what it should

        // CHALLENGE 3
        // Don't stop with only 2 tests from challenge 2
        // Come up with 2 more tests that don't have the same functionality as the existing tests
        // Think of another strings we should pass to test if the method actually works
        // There's another special input value that we'd want to test
        // and which will reveal another bug in our code

        // CHALLENGE 4
        // Write a test for the everyNthChar() method
        // Input: char array containing 'h, 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' in that order, and n = 2
        // Output: char array containing the letters 'e', 'l', in that order

        // CHALLENGE 5
        // Add a test for a case, when the value of n is greater than the length of the string
